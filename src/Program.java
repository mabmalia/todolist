/**
 *  This class is the main class of the MyToDo application.
 *  MyToDo is a very simple, text based todo list application.

 *  Users can create new tasks, assign them a title and due date,
 *  and choose a project for that task to belong to.
 *  Users can also edit, mark as done or remove tasks.
 *
 *  The application saves the current task list to file when the user quits,
 *  and then restarts with the former state restored.
