# todo list
This is a todo list application. The application uses a text based user interface via the command-line.
The application allows a user to create new tasks (assign a title, a due date and a project) and edit them (update, mark as done, remove).
If the user quits the application, the current task list is saved to a file. The application is restarted with the former state restored.
