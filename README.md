# MyToDo
This is a simple todo list application.

## Description
The application uses a text based user interface via the command-line.

It allows a user to create new tasks (assign a title, due date and a project) and edit them (update title or project, mark as done, remove).

If the user quits the application, the current list of tasks is saved to a csv file. The application is then restarted with the former state restored.

## Motivation
This is an individual project for a software development academy.
