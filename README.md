# Title
<p>This is a simple todo list application.</p>

## Description
<p>The application uses a text based user interface via the command-line.</p>
<p>The application allows a user to create new tasks (assign a title, due date and a project) and edit them (update title or project, mark as done, remove).</p>
<p>If the user quits the application, the current list of tasks is saved to a csv file. The application is restarted with the former state restored.</p>

## Motivation
<p>This is an individual project for a software development academy.</p>

## Contributing
